Module 8 Journal Entry 
The Gaming Room is the client.  expand their already established gaming platform for their Draw It Or Lose It game, that would allow users to 
participate in the game on multiple platforms, versus the current android only version.  
The client is asking that a mobile platform be created that works with both Android and iPhone.  Each game and team name needs to be unique, 
and the game should only allow one instance of the game to exist in memory at a time. 
Each team will have more than one player assigned per team, and the game will need the ability to have multiple or single teams playing per game.
I believe I made the correct recommendations based on the clientâ€™s needs.  I would go back and revise some of the pros/cons of development. 
I learned a lot through the class, and some ideas have changed.  Trial and error is something I use when writing my code.  Sometimes 
using the help of others through sites like reddit help with stumbling blocks that could be in the way.
